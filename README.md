## USDT-TRANSFERS-THE-GRAPH

This is my first deployment of a subgraph following the graph protocol.

This deployment here allows querying this subgraph in order to have information about any transfer of USDT tokens.

You may want to query here: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/tomrpl/usdt-transfers?selected=playground
following the format of GraphQl.

One has access to the ID, the Block number, the addresses from and To and the amount of tokens.
